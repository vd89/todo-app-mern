# TODO Application with Node, Express, MongoDb and React

### Create a ToDo web app which has the following functionalities:

1. Add ToDo
2. Modify ToDo
3. Update ToDo
4. Assign category/labels to a ToDo(Optional)
5. View all ToDos
6. Filter and view ToDos by Date, Category (Optional)
7. UI must be attractive

The frontend part should be built on React JS. Using Redux would be a plus though not compulsory.
The web app should be secured with an authentication system.

Implementing the following will give extra points:

1. Making a backend for the same using Node.js.
2. Use Firestore as a database. Or any non-relational database.
3. Deploying the application/server online. You may use Heroku for the same.
